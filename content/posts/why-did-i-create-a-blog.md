## Short story about me

Welcome to my blog! I think for the first blog post in my life it would be nice to introduce myself however I'm a shy person however I have to :)

I'm Dmytro a guy from Ukraine who has been programming for 7 years, I'm a self-taught passionate programmer and former marathon runner. Last 5 years I worked on freelance as a frontend developer, eventually I used to create only simple projects where you only need to know a little bit of Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS. It seems to me that I have stucked as a developer for 5 years and now I decided to curb web development with the best technologies, tools, and libraries.

## War in Ukraine

On 24th February 2022, all Ukrainians were waked up by Russian missiles and bombs since this day everything changed for good.

The most stresful and tragedic moment in one's life

## Why am I Blogging?

There are several reasons to start blogging like:

- I hope my articles will be useful for some people, I will work hard to make my articles useful.
- Through this blog, I hope to inspire others by sharing my journey and help them find their own unique voice.
- It will help me to improve my English, I have been studying English for 3 years but I lack english practice.
- I wanted to use these stories as a way of expressing myself.
- Writing a blog will allow me to explore different web development technologies (frameworks, libraries, tools) thus I will enhance my development skills.
- Probably it can help to get a job or work in a team with great ideas :)

## What I'm going to blog about

I know that The Internet is filled with unlimited resources, and blogs already but I won't give up :) I hope my posts will stand out, mainly I'm going to blog about my journey as a web developer, about what I know and I don't
