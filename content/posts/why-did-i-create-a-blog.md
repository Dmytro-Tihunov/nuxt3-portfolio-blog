## Short story about me

Welcome to my blog! I think for the first blog post in my life it would be nice to introduce myself however I'm a shy person however I have to :)

I'm Dmytro a guy from Ukraine who has been programming for 7 years, I'm a self-taught passionate programmer. Last 5 years I worked on freelance as a frontend developer, eventually I used to create only simple projects where you only need to know a little bit of Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS. It seems to me that I have stucked as a developer for 5 years and now I decided to curb web development with the best technologies, tools, and libraries.

## War in Ukraine

On 24th February 2022, all Ukrainians were waked up by Russian missiles and bombs

The most impressive phrase that I've heared in my life, There are many phrases have been said but this one is my favorite

## Why am I Blogging?

There are several reasons to start blogging like:

- It will help me to improve my English, I have been studying English for 3 years but I lack english practice.
- I wanted to use these stories as a way of expressing myself.
- Writing blog will allow me to explore different web development technologies (frameworks, libraries, tools) thus I will enhance my development skills.
- Probably it can help to get a job :)
